# House Pricing Prediction using Linear Regression
This project is my first project as an intern at Prodigy Info Tech Company, focusing on machine learning for linear regression to predict house prices. The goal of this project is to develop a model that accurately predicts house prices based on various features such as size, location, number of bedrooms, etc.

Introduction
In this project, I have implemented a machine learning model using linear regression to predict house prices. Linear regression is a simple yet powerful technique for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables. The model is trained on a dataset containing features such as house size, location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.

Installation
To run this project, you need Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn

Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score. These metrics help assess how well the model is performing in terms of predicting house prices.
